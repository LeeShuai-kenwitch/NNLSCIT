# K-Nearest-Neighbor Local Sampling Based Conditional Independence Testing
This is a python code of the paper "K-Nearest-Neighbor Local Sampling Based Conditional Independence Testing" which is accepted at the NeurIPS 2023.
The goal of this algorithm is to test conditional independence between variables X and Y conditional on Z.
# Parameter
We set the number of repetitions B = 200 and the neighbor order k = 7 for our simulation studies and real data analysis.
